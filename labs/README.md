# Labs

The course is organized around weekly labs in which you'll build the methods described in lecture _from scratch_. These labs require a fair amount of Python familiarity, but they are also mostly self-contained and well documented.

## Colab
The labs should run "out of the box" on Google Colab. Each lab should have an "Open in Colab" link that you can click on via the Github notebook previewer, but if it fails to load for some reason, you can get a Colab link as follows:
```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/slinderman/stats320/blob/main/labs/<lab_file_name.ipynb>
```

## Errata
If you find issues with the labs, please open Github issues or pull requests to fix them!
